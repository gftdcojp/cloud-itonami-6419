  catalog -- the G2-style spec-basis table the Monetary Intermediation
  Governor checks every `:compliance/verify` proposal against ('did the
  advisor cite an OFFICIAL public source for this jurisdiction's AML/
  KYC framework, or did it invent one?').

  Coverage is reported HONESTLY (see `coverage`), the same discipline
  every sibling actor's `facts` namespace uses: a jurisdiction not in
  this table has NO spec-basis, full stop -- the advisor must not
  fabricate one, and the governor holds if it tries.

  Seed values are drawn from each jurisdiction's official financial-
  crimes/prudential-supervision authority and AML/KYC law (see
  `:provenance`); they are a STARTING catalog, not a from-scratch
  survey of all ~194 jurisdictions. Extending coverage is additive:
  add one map to `catalog`, cite a real source, done -- never invent a
  jurisdiction's requirements to make coverage look bigger.")

   ;;      III Ch. 2, "Licensing", Arts. 64-77 -- confirmed from the
   ;;      CBUAE's own published law text);
   ;;   2) Dubai's DIFC (Dubai International Financial Centre) is a
   ;;      separate financial free zone with its OWN regulator, the DFSA
   ;;      (Dubai Financial Services Authority), which administers its
   ;;      own DIFC laws -- chiefly the "Regulatory Law 2004" (confirmed
   ;;      from dfsa.ae's own "Legislation" page: "The Laws administered
   ;;      by the DFSA ... Regulatory Law 2004 ..."; DFSA's own footer
   ;;      describes it as "a body established under Dubai law", i.e.
   ;;      Dubai/DIFC law, not the federal CBUAE regime);
   ;;   3) Abu Dhabi's ADGM (Abu Dhabi Global Market) is a THIRD, likewise
   ;;      distinct free zone with its own regulator, the FSRA (Financial
   ;;      Services Regulatory Authority) -- confirmed reachable directly
   ;;      via adgm.com ("ADGM's FSRA Publishes Its 2025 Annual Report

   ;; ADGM/FSRA are real, separately-licensed banking regimes but are
   ;; deliberately left OUT of this entry rather than conflated into it;
   ;; a `"ARE-DIFC"`/`"ARE-ADGM"`-style key (or similar) would be the
   ;; honest way to extend coverage to them, with its own citation, not
   ;; folded silently into this one.
